		<div>Some service experience and reasonable understanding of the equipment used in the workshop is required. Before attending this workshop the learner should meet the following prerequisites:
Trained to provide field service on Blueline API and QTRAP instrumentsTrained to provide field service on Agilent and/or Shimadzu HPLC instrumentsPerformed 6 to 12 service calls in the last year on Blueline API and QTRAP instruments Performed 6 to 12 service calls in the last year on Agilent and/or Shimadzu HPLC instrumentsJob ResponsibilitiesOne important function of the FSE is to troubleshoot LC/MS instrumentation. To be able to troubleshoot they need to know how instrumentation works and how it is used by the customer. This includes hardware, software, computer, and workflow as well as the lab environment this takes place in. To efficiently troubleshoot the FSE needs to understand the importance of a methodical troubleshooting process, types of symptoms, which decisions can speed up the troubleshooting process and repair or cause delays, and how to reduce the chance for ‘repeat’ service calls.

		<div>Blueline API/QTRAP coupled to Agilent or Shimadzu HPLC</div>
		<div>Troubleshooting LCMS instrumentation in an effective way does not necessarily require many years of experience and a deep understanding of instrument functionality. Good troubleshooting has much to do with the time spent to observe the symptoms and devising a work plan to test causes before getting to work on the problem.
This workshop teaches a methodical 4-step process that can be applied to solving problems with complex instrumentation such as LCMS. The participant will learn an effective interview technique to collect detailed information from the customer and how to use observations to increase fault finding accuracy. The learner will practice this approach on real problems implemented by the instructor on various LCMS configurations.
Out of scope tasksThis workshop teaches an effective way to troubleshoot complex systems. This is not an ‘advanced’ instrument hardware training; however, the instructor will be happy to provide explanation and opportunities to learn more about the equipment as needed and as time permits.
